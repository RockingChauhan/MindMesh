      <h2>Applications</h2>
    </center>
    <br>
    <h1>Automatic Speech Recognition</h1>
     <p>Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. 
        LSTM RNNs can learn "Very Deep Learning" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms.</p>
    <h1>Image Recognition</h1>
    <p>Deep learning-based image recognition has become "superhuman", producing more accurate results than human contestants. 
    This first occurred in 2011 in recognition of traffic signs, and in 2014, with recognition of human faces.</p>
    <h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
    <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. </p>
    <h1>Drug Discovery and Toxicology</h1>
    <p>AtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design.
     AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.</p>
    <h1>Customer Relationship Management System</h1>
    <p>Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables. 
    The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value.</p>
    <h1>Recommendation Systems</h1> 
    <p>Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music and journal recommendations.
     Multi-view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. 
    The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.</p>
    <h1>Medical Image Analaysis</h1>
    <p>Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:right;">and many more...</h1>
