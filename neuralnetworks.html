      <h1>Artificial Neural Networks</h1>
    
     <p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
       Such systems learn & progressively improve their ability to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming.</p>

    <p>An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). 
        Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it.
         Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1.
         Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.</p>
      
    <p>Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
        As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections.
         Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans. </p>
         
            <h1>Deep Neural Networks</h1>
          
           <p>A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
                There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. 
               These components functioning similar to the human brains and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.</p>
      
          <p>DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.
              The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.
               For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.</p>
            
          <p>DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back.
               At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. 
               If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.
               That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.</p>
               <h1>Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
               <p>Convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision.
                 CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).</p>
               <h1>Recurrent Neural Networks</h1>
               <p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling.
                 Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.</p>
